Provides an option to hide blocks from printing.

== Description ==

The plugin adds a toggle to the Advanced panel of a block's settings to hide the block from printing.

== Usage ==
When you toggle the print setting in the advanced panel, the plugin adds or removes a `hide-from-print` class to the block. The styles included with this plugin are not intended to be greedy, so if your theme styles set a display property on blocks, you may need to declare your own styles for the `hide-from-print` class to ensure it overrides other display properties.
